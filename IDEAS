How to Maintain State for Users

* Keep a file per session ID

Literally generate a file of the name $docroot/state-sessionid.hs
which is loaded each time a user evaluates an expression. Should be a
pruning process of about an hour or so.

** Pros

Idea is simple, one file per session.

** Cons

The interpreter therefore must be reset per evaluation. This resetting
and loading may really slow down the process. I will have to test it.

* Detecting top-level declarations

Use Language.Haskell.Parser (or somesuch?) to detect top-level
declarations?

* Forget top-level declarations all together

Go with a DrScheme approach of everything that is not an expression
going in a separate textarea and then being loaded for playing with.

* Limits

  - Limit number and size of definitions.
  - Or limit length of file.
